# Radiant Earth Mali Crop Type Tutorials

This folder contains two notebook tutorials to create a baseline model for the Mali Crop Type dataset. The dataset for this challenge consists of time-series of satellite data from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral observations.

You can use the [sjssw](1. Extract_Data.ipynb) notebook to load the data. 

The second notebook [2. Data_Exploration](2. Data_Exploration.ipynb) contains a baseline model using U-Net to walk you through the process of loading and structuring the data, training the model, and visualizing the results.
